The attacker can manipulate the DNS resolution process by sending a response that appears to be from a legitimate source, but in reality, it is from a malicious source. This can lead to the redirection of traffic to a malicious website, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card numbers, or other personal data. This attack can be carried out through various methods, including DNS cache poisoning or man-in-the-middle attacks. Spoof DNS responses can be prevented by implementing secure DNS protocols and regularly monitoring DNS traffic.","Flagged":false,"AndOperator":false,"Parent":"A21","Children":["A23","A24"],"Referrers":null,"References":null,"Impact":3,"ImpactSubclasses":null,"ThreatActor":4,"Complexity":2,"STRIDE":2,"Controls":null,"OutOfScope":false},"A23":{"ID":"A23","Title":"Perform Cache Poisoning Attacks","Description":"Cache poisoning attacks are a type of cyber attack aimed at corrupting the DNS (Domain Name System) cache of a targeted website or network. This attack involves an attacker sending fake DNS requests to the DNS server, which in turn responds with a fake IP address that leads to a malicious website instead of the intended website. The attacker then uses this malicious website to steal sensitive information or launch further attacks. Cache poisoning attacks can be particularly dangerous as they can go undetected for long periods and affect a large number of users.","Flagged":false,"AndOperator":false,"Parent":"A22","Children":null,"Referrers":null,"References":null,"Impact":3,"ImpactSubclasses":null,"ThreatActor":4,"Complexity":2,"STRIDE":1,"Controls":null,"OutOfScope":false},"A24":{"ID":"A24","Title":"Spoof Responses to DNS Queries","Description":"Spoofing responses to DNS queries is a form of cyber attack where an attacker redirects a user’s request for a website to a fake website that appears to be legitimate. This is done by intercepting the DNS query and providing a false IP address to the user’s computer. The user is then directed to the fake website, where they may unwittingly provide sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card details, or personal information. This type of attack can be particularly dangerous because it can be difficult for users to detect, and the fake website may appear to be identical to the legitimate one. It is important for organizations to implement strong DNS security measures to protect against these types of attacks.","Flagged":false,"AndOperator":false,"Parent":"A22","Children":null,"Referrers":null,"References":null,"Impact":3,"ImpactSubclasses":null,"ThreatActor":4,"Complexity":2,"STRIDE":1,"Controls":null,"OutOfScope":false},"A25":{"ID":"A25","Title":"ETH - Update SSI Registry","Description":"Attacker updates the registry with random values to obtain a malfunction in the D-PKI protocol.","Flagged":false,"AndOperator":false,"Parent":"A1","Children":["A26"],"Referrers":null,"References":null,"Impact":3,"ImpactSubclasses":null,"ThreatActor":6,"Complexity":4,"STRIDE":5,"Controls":null,"OutOfScope":false},"A26":{"ID":"A26","Title":"ETH Private Key Compromised","Description":"Attacker obtains the private key of the ethereum account connected the DID.
